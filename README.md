# DnD_5e_Character_randomizer

I decided to work on something productive for myself for coding and for dungeons and dragons.

This is an idea I was toying around with for a little bit. Suppose you're doing a one-shot campaign, and you want all random characters. Why not write code to make them?


Someone has probably already made something much more comprehensive than this, but I wanted to try to do it.

Current goals for this project:
* Include the basic stuff from the Players' Handbook (PHB)
  + Races
  + Classes
  + Backgrounds
  + Spells & Cantrips
* The culmination of this is going to be able to generate a level one character randomly so that someone would be ready to play.

Once the current goals have been met, I would like to implement some of the classes, races, and other features included in other modules of the game. Additionally, I'd like to explore writing a function that would create a character at a given level, or of a given race or a given class.

A stretch goal that I have would be to somehow put it into a pdf or a document to make it more palatable. Or to make a flask app of it. 

Once I'm mostly finished with this, I'm going to transfer it from a jupyter notebook into python scripts. I work well in a jupyter notebook so that's why I'm working in it. Though Spyder may help with this. 

This is a work in progress. Currently, the code is the most comlplete for Elf, Human, or Dwarf as a Fighter with the Noble background.

I'm also doing this to learn a bit more about the other classes and races. If anything could be improved, please let me know. Thank you!
