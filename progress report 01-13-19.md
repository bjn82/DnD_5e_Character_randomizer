#  Progress report 1/13/19

I fixed the issues and closed the report. Also, did a lot more work on equipment, particularly the attack stats for weapons. 

The code can now be called with one function, though that function calls the internal functions. I probably could get away with making the functions parameterless, instead calling a global variable `player_sheet`, though that's a project for a later point. 

On the agenda for next time: 
1. Add Dragonborn to the races.
2. Add Ranger, Paladin, or Sorcerer to the classes. 
3. Finish the Sailor background and the Soldier background, then look at adding another background. 
4. Begin thinking about how to go about weapon selection. 
  + Should it be purely random selection or should it be random from a list of weapons that fit the given parameters (such as if a dwarven barbarian is proficient in greataxe, then let them pick a greataxe, whereas if a wood-elf fighter that is a dual-wielder is proficient in longsword and shortsword, perhaps then let them pick a combo of those.)
  + This part isn't going to be done tomorrow, most likely, but I'll begin thinking about how to proceed with it and potentially push a draft of it in a branch. 

Thanks for reading! If anyone has any suggestions, comments, concerns, criticisms, I'll gladly listen.
