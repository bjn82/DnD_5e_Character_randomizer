As stated in the issues tab, I ran into an issue with the Fighting Style and Equipment. Namely accessing fighting style, since it is a dictionary within a list. I had similar issues earlier, though for those it was the issue of unneccessarily using square brackets in addition to curly brackets.

# Races: 
* Elf, Human, Halfling, and Dwarf are done. 
* Half-elf, Gnome, Dragonborn, Tiefling, and Half-orc haven't been started. 
* High elf's cantrip needs to be done, either by adding in a specific spellcasting thing for it or including the spellcasting section of the data earlier. 
* Dark elf's magical stuff has to be done better. 
* **Fix `Features & Traits`**
* Look into randomizing the heights, weights, etc based on the variation in the Players' Handbook. 

# Classes: 
* Barbarian is nearly complete
* Wizard is mostly complete
* Fighter is nearly done, though there is the snag about how to deal with the Features & Traits. 

# Stats: 
* See if how stats are being allocated for classes is the best way to do it. 

# Backgrounds: 
* Noble & Sailor are done
* 

# Equipment
* Berserker and Fighter are in there, though fighter is causing issues (as stated before). 
* Once the boilerplate code is in for picking stuff, then implement actual weapon selection.
