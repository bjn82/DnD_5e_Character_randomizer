#  Progress report 1/15/19

Today's progress
* I toyed around with a weapon selection function, but I'm not pleased with it. 
* Finished equipment for ranger, and also included the penalty for not meeting strength requirement for chainmail, as well as made it so that it wouldn't be picked if a fighter doesn't have the right strength. 
* Added half-elf to races. 

Most of today was spent working on the weapon selection function, which didn't turn out as I want. the code is included, but it's too messy. Maybe tomorrow I'll get to redo it. 

Goals for tomorrow:
1. Add Paladin or Sorcerer to Class
2. Add hermit or sage to backgrounds
3. fix the weapon selection system. 

Not as much progress as usual, but some progress is better than no progress! Thanks, and have a good day.
