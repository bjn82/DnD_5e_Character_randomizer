#  Progress report 1/14/19

Issues were fixed, and progress was made
* Neatened up the code to remove redundancy and make things simpler
* Added Dragonborn and Gnome to the Races
* Added Ranger to the Class
* Added Soldier to Backgrounds

On the agenda for next time: 
1. Fill in informationequipment for Ranger **and** double check that equipment for other classes is finished. 
2. Add Half-Elf  or Half-Orc to Races
3. Add Paladin or Sorcerer to Class
4. Add Hermit or Sage to Background. 
5. Add equipment information for Paladin or Sorcerer

Other notes: I've got a gig tomorrow evening that I'm working, so I'm not sure how much progress will be made. What isn't finished tomorrow I'll finish for 1/16/19, and finish those. The most important thing is to do the equipment for Ranger **and** finish any missing equipment information for the other classes (Fighter, Berserker, and Wizard). 

That's all for tonight. Thank you for reading, and I hope you have a good evening!
